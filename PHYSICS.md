# Bonsai Physics

For now, you can just watch plants reproduce (and die).
You can also click plant to inspect its genome, signals, stats etc.
Simulated factors are energy, mutation, and in-cell signaling based growth.


## Plant Model
A plant consists of organ-scale cells, each of them contains
set of signals. A plant also has a single scalar energy, which is shared among the all cells in the
plant.


# Energy Model
In bonsai, each plant has stored energy which changes over time from several factors. Only way to
produce energy is via photosynthesis, and it's simulated by number of rays hitting cells that contains
chloroplast. (it also affects shadow)

Everything else (including mere existence) costs energy and
plants with low energy turns blue and eventually dies.


# Cell Model
A cell contains signals, which is a string of alphabets. Signals are generated by expression of a gene.

Genome consists of gene, and each gene looks like
(condition, production). Condition determines a probability of generating the signals in production
term, by
multiplying concentration of each signal.

Some signals have special builtin meanings:

* `dαβ`: produce new cell containing signal α in direction β
* `rα`: delete signal α
* `chlr`: act as chloroplast
* `x`, `y`, `z`: grow in specified direction
